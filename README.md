Reading will be assigned for many classes.  Quizzes may be given to assess your preparedness.  The participation score will be based on quiz performance, class attendance, summaries of required papers, and participation in class discussion and activities.

The exam portion of your grade will be based on one in-class midterm and a final exam. You are responsible for being in class on the day of the exam (including the final exam). Make-up exams will be given only in the case of a medical emergency verified by a doctor's note. 

The programming labs portion of your grade will be based on substantial programming assignments given throughout the semester. In most cases, your grade will be based on the code you submit as well an oral explanation and demonstration of the program on the day the project is due. The submission is through github. Late submissions will not be accepted.  Extensions will be granted only in the case of a medical emergency verified by a doctor's note.

Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact USF Student Disability Services (SDS) at (415) 422-2613 within the first week of class, or immediately upon onset of disability, to speak with a disability specialist. If you are determined eligible for reasonable accommodations, please provide me with your SDS Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form, and we will discus your needs for this course. For more information, please visit: http://www.usfca.edu/sds (Links to an external site.) or call (415) 422-2613.

I would like to hear from anyone who has a disability which may require seating modifications or testing accommodations or accommodations of other class requirements, so that appropriate arrangements may be made. Please contact me during my office hours or make an appointment.

Academic Honesty

Simply put, do not cheat and do not plagiarize or copy from other students or from the web. I expect all students to adhere to the academic honesty policies at USF. For more information, please refer to the Fogcutter Student Handbook (Links to an external site.).
